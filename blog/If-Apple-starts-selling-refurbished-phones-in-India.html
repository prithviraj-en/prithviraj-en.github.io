			<p>
				As of Q2 2016, Apple sold 800,000  smartphones of the total 30.7 million smartphones sold in India. This translates to 
				about 2.5% smartphone market share for Apple. Apple’s market share has fallen from 4% in Q2 2015  to 2.5%, a fall of 
				about 35% annually. On the other hand, smartphone shipments in India rose from 23.2 million units in Q2 2015  to 30.7 
				million, a 28% annual growth. This clearly shows that Apple’s market share has drastically fallen owing to the high prices 
				of their phones and problems in setting up retail stores in India, while other players have started to set up 
				manufacturing units in India which further lowers the costs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The average cost of a brand new iPhone in India is INR 42,000  whereas the average  Indian buyer spends around INR 
				10,000  on a smartphone. The main market for iPhones are the upper middle class and highly affluent families, who have 
				a high disposable income. Even among these families, most would opt for an Android smartphone instead of an iPhone 
				due to the availability of free software available for Android and a general compatibility with existing systems. Apple’s 
				iPhones, on the other hand, suffer from a fatal weakness. Software for iPhones are generally not free, Apple Maps 
				doesn’t work in India, ITunes still doesn’t work well with Indian markets and iPhones are generally incompatible with 
				PCs, other smartphones and preceding models of iPhones. Coupled with the absence of Apple’s own retail stores in 
				India, this deters most consumers from purchasing an iPhone , even if they have a very high disposable income. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us for research purposes, assume that Apple starts selling refurbished phones in India. Since all the components of 
				an iPhone have to be imported, the price of a refurbished iPhone would reduce only by 15-30%. Comparing with other 
				markets (ex. America), the price of a refurbished phone is reduced by 15-20 %, this would lead to the price being around 
				INR 29,000-  34,000  (savings of around INR 8000).  These refurbished phones are sourced from existing consumers who 
				opt for buyback programs. Since, the Indian govt. declined Apple’s proposal to import used iPhones and sell them in 
				India, Apple would have to sell refurbished iPhones bought back from existing Indian iPhone users. This tells us that the 
				supply of refurbished phones in India will be extremely limited. We can safely assume that 50% of new iPhones sold will 
				be bought back by Apple to be refurbished and re-sold. The average iPhone user typically uses an iPhone for about 12 
				months before he/she buys a new phone. So, if a new i Phone model is launched, it would take at least a year for it to 
				land in the refurbished phone market. Seeing as Apple generally launches a new model within 24 months, this would be 
				an added disadvantage for a refurbished iPhone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				High-end Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S series, Google’s Nexus phones, HTC models, Sony’s Xperia Z and LG’s 
				smartphones are priced around INR 35,000.  We can expect that refurbished iPhones will gain a share of this segment. 
				The exact percentage will depend on a lot of other factors like availability, supply, after-sales experience, quality, 
				durability, etc. From Apple, we can expect high quality and better than average after sales experience. So, the market 
				share it will gain will ultimately be decided by its availability and supply.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other countries, Apple sells refurbished devices online, not through their retail stores. We can expect the same trend 
				in India. This effectively reduces Apple’s refurbished iPhone market to tier-1 cities. Since internet penetration in tier-2 
				and tier-3 cities is extremely low, online sales in these cities would be proportionately lower.  Also, it has been seen that 
				year on year growth in tier-2 and tier-3 cities is higher than the growth in other cities. Supply of refurbished phones will 
				also be limited and proportional to the number of new iPhone sales. We can safely assume that the number of 
				refurbished iPhones available in the market will be around 60% of the sales of new iPhones. Analyzing for Q2 2016, 
				800,000  iPhones were sold which means approximately 480,000 refurbished iPhones will be sold/available in the market 
				by next year. If we assume that using these refurbished iPhones changes their perception and prompts the consumers to 
				buy brand-new, updated iPhone models, the market share for Apple will increase from the present 2.5% to about 3.6% 
				(2.5 + 0.5 x 2.5, not factoring growth forecasts). If Apple’s growth forecasts are to be believed, sales of iPhones have grown by a staggering 51%. Factoring these growth forecasts and the sales of re furbished iPhones, Apple’s share in the 
				smartphone market in India should grow to around 4 % - 4.5%. This would further lead to an increase in the supply of 
				refurbished iPhones, leading to further growth in sales.
