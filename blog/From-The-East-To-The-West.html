			<p>Africa is the birthplace of mankind. The hunter-gatherers from Africa
			migrated to other places in search of rivers, forests and bigger hunting
			grounds.</p>
			<p>The Nile delta in Egypt became the birthplace of the great Egyptian
			civilization. Egypt was the centre of power back in its day. They were the
			richest people of the time as can be seen from their tombs filled with gold
			and precious stones. A group of people settled near the Tigris –Euphrates
			rivers giving birth to the Mesopotamian civilization. The Mesopotamian
			Civilization is widely considered to be the cradle of civilization. Due to its
			proximity to the seas and rivers, Mesopotamia rose to power. It became a
			very powerful trading hub. Together, the Egyptians and the Mesopotamians
			were the most powerful civilizations around 10th – 8th century BCE.</p>

			<p>Around 8th century BCE, trading cities started flourishing around the
			Mediterranean. These cities started gaining power due to the wealth
			generated from trade with the Mesopotamians. This led to the rise of
			Ancient Greece. The Greeks realized that trade was absolutely necessary
			for power and survival. So they raised large armies and navies. The Greeks had
			the most disciplined and powerful navies in the world. This effectively
			allowed them to control the seas. Whoever controlled the seas controlled the trade routes. Around the same time, the Mesopotamian civilization started
			breaking up into smaller parts. This, coupled with the rise of the Greeks led
			to the gradual fall of the Mesopotamian civilization.</p>

			<p>The center of power had now shifted to Greece. The Greeks made a lot of
			progress in science, technology, philosophy, etc. The Greeks were at their zenith during this time 6th-4th century BCE. But this was short-lived, long wars with the Persians
			followed by internal turmoil threatened to destroy Greece. The Athenians
			and Spartans were always at war. These internal wars kept Greece divided.Alexander of Macedonia finally united them but after his death in 323 BCE,Greece could never regain its past glories.</p>

			<p>Around this time, the Romans came to power. Rome as a city was founded
			by the twins Romulus and Remus who were of Greek descent.(Castaways from the Trojan War). So it is possible that the Roman Empire had Greek origins. The
			Roman Empire grew slowly —it took 500 years for the small city of
			Rome to conquer present day Italy completely—but by the 1st century CE , its frontiers
			stretched from Spain in the west to Syria in the east. This vast empire of
			more than 60 million people was held together by a strong and efficient
			system of provincial government, backed by the army. The Roman empire
			produced many a famous generals - Julius Caesar, Pompeii, Mark Antony,
			Augustus Caesar,etc. But as has been the case with many nations; long
			wars, arrogance and ignorance on the part of rulers (Nero, etc.) led to the
			downfall of the Romans. After emperor Augustus’ death, Rome lost its
			sheen. All the emperors who came to power after Augustus died violent
			deaths. Romans slowly lost power after fighting wars with the barbarians
			(Goths, Vandals, Franks) and the empire broke off into many small
			fragments.</p>

			<p>The centre of power gradually started shifting north towards Britain. The Franks, Vandals, Vikings who eventually settled in Brittania(Britain).
			</p>
			<p>The marriage of English king Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon had produced no male heir.
			The king asked the Pope to grant him a divorce so he could marry
			Anne Boleyn, but the Pope refused. Henry VIII broke-off with the Catholic
			Church and made himself head of the Church of England. He married Anne
			but later had her beheaded. He would go on to have four more wives.</p>
